# GeekSkool - JSON Parser Project


### What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data-interchange format commonly used for exchanging data between a browser and a server.

* Sending Data--If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server(JSON.stringify())

* Receiving Data--If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript object(JSON.parse())

### JSON - Evaluates to JavaScript Objects

The JSON format is almost identical to JavaScript objects.
JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

* Data is in name/value pairs
* Data is separated by commas
* Curly braces hold objects
* Square brackets hold arrays

In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

* a string
* a number
* an object (JSON object)
* an array
* a boolean
* null

### How to run the application Locally

* clone/download the repository
* install node
* run command "node jsonReader.js <file-path>" 

### Unit Testing

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that user can easily write tests.

To run unit tests, open index.html (inside jasmine folder) on the browser.
